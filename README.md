# demo-flask-app

Sample flask app for CI integration testing

This flask app is a three tier python app:-

- Web UI in a ReactJS static file folder (react-time-ui)
- Python Flask RESTful API service (flask-time-api)
- Postgres database layer (migrations part of flask-time-api)

There are Dockerfiles for each of the two 'apps' in the Dockerfiles folder
